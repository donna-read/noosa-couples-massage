    <h1>Therapies</h1>
    <article>
      <p>My signature massage is actually a combination of styles and techniques.</p>
      <p>It's a whole body treatment, head, face, feet, tummy, back, hips, glutes, legs, arms, hands, shoulders, neck, ears, chest, some deep and light pressure, some stretches, trigger points and acupressure points.</p>
      <p>All performed using hot rocks or heat pads and ending with a soothing peppermint foot massage.</p>
      <p>This is by far my most common and favoured treatment.</p>
      <p>It will leave you feeling relaxed, youthful and relived of tension - no more aches and pains!</p>
      <p>I use only organic oils when doing my treatments. Base oils, massage blends and pure essential oils are available for purchase.</p>
      <p>All treatments times range from 15 minutes to 3 hours.</p>
      <p>The following therapies are available for you to pick and choose from:</p>

      <h2>Deep tissue</h2>
      <p>Deep tissue is a type of massage therapy that focuses on realigning deeper layers of muscles and connective tissue.
        It is especially helpful for chronically tense and contracted areas such as stiff necks, low back tightness, and sore shoulders.
        Some of the same strokes are used as classic massage therapy, but the movement is slower and the pressure is deeper and concentrated on areas of tension and pain.</p>

      <h2>Hot Stone</h2>
      <p>Hot stone massage is a variation on classic massage therapy. Heated smooth, flat stones are placed on key points on the body. The massage therapist may also hold the stones and use them to massage certain areas of the body.
        The hot stones are usually made of basalt, a type of rock that is rich in iron, so they retain heat.
        The stones are immersed in water and heated in an electric heating device until they are within a certain temperature range. The stones may be placed at specific points on the back, in the palms of the hand, or between the toes.
        The heat warms and relaxes the muscles, which allows the therapist to apply deeper pressure, if desired.</p>

      <h2>Reflexology</h2>
      <p>Reflexology is an alternative medicine which involves the act of applying pressure to the hands, feet and ears with specific thumb, finger and hand techniques without the use of massage oil or lotion.
        It is based on a system of zones and reflex areas that reflect an image of the body on the feet and hands, with the premise that such work effects a physical change to the body.
        Reflexology is a delightful therapy that does wonders for the whole body.
        It does not leave anything out. Not only does reflexology make you feel totally relaxed and feeling radiant, it works on a much deeper level of repairing and harmonising the whole body.
        In short it's a body tune up. Treatments can take a half hour but a full reflexology session usually takes 1 hour.
        Some of the benefits of reflexology include: relief of stress and tension, improved blood supply and promote the unblocking of nerve impulses to help the body achieve balance.
        I always include a little bit of reflexology in all my body work to enhance the massage by working on the areas in the feet that needed the most work and in the body, ie. neck, lower back and shoulders.</p>

      <h2>Pregnancy Massage</h2>
      <p>Prenatal massage refers to specific massage techniques that have been shown to reduce pregnancy discomforts and to enhance the physiological and emotional well-being of both mother and fetus.
        Pregnancy is a tumultuous period for a womans mind and body.
        Any woman who has been pregnant can sympathise with the mental and physical fatigue associated with being pregnant.
        Not only does a woman experience physical changes, she also experiences mental changes as well.
        Massage has been known to calm many of the aches and pains associated with pregnancy such as sciatica, swelling, back and neck pain, and stomach upset.
        Prenatal massage has also been shown to improve physical discomforts by encouraging circulation and by stretching the muscles and joints to their full range of motion to improve skin elasticity and body tone.
        Studies show that pregnant women who receive regular prenatal massages are more at ease - furthermore relaxing the fetus inside their womb.</p>

      <h2>Couples Massage</h2>
      <p>Looking for the perfect way to indulge yourself and your partner?
        Need some time to reconnect, relax and revive?
        You and your partner will enjoy the wonders of massage together in harmony in the same room side by side, by two different therapists.
        It can be a husband and wife, girlfriend and boyfriend, life partners, mums and daughters or even best friends.</p>

      <h2>Wedding Massage</h2>
      <p>During highly stressful situations, paying attention to your mind, body and spirit is the most important thing you can do for yourself.
        By getting a massage on a regular basis, starting several months before your wedding, can substantially relieve mental and physical tension.
        Stress has many symptoms: headaches, anxiety, neck and backaches, nervousness, irritability, increased blood pressure, heart palpitations, and chronic fatigue.
        You may find yourself experiencing some of these symptoms when dealing with a tight budget, chronic delays, uncooperative vendors, and other problems that might arise.
        Full body massage is good at any time and especially beneficial in promoting good health and relieving anxiety experienced by the bride on her wedding day.</p>

      <h2>Corporate Massage</h2>
      <p>Many companies are now using our corporate massage programs to reward and motivate their valuable employees.
        Massage at your workplace, corporate function or event is the healthy, holistic and fun way to pamper your staff.
        A short corporate massage session can allow your staff to refocus and achieve mental clarity.
        It's motivational, leaving recipients feeling rewarded and uplifted.
        Also popular at trade shows and conferences, seated massage can give you the edge on your competitors!</p>

      <h2>Trigger Point</h2>
      <p>A trigger point, defined by Janet Travell, M.D., is "a hyper-irritable spot usually within a taut band of skeletal muscle or its fascia that is painful on compression and can give rise to characteristic referred pain, tenderness and autonomic phenomena."
        Trigger points reduce full range of motion by preventing full lengthening of the muscle.
        Trigger point therapy releases these spots by using repetitive muscle stripping, ischemic compression and cold distraction "spray and stretch" techniques.
        Any stretching therapy that lengthens and strengthens has similar benefits to the practices of Pilates and yoga.</p>

      <h2>Cupping</h2>
      <p>Cupping is applied to the body by introducing a naked flame to the cup to create a vacuum, which is then applied to the skin and draws a little up to seal itself.
        The amount of pressure applied varies with the size of the flame.
        A cupping therapy is an advanced form of Chinese medicine and is performed through the application of placing glass to the skin.
        This helps elevate pain, removes toxins and allows the body to feel free and rested.
        The glasses act as a vacuum and suck the extra heat thereby improving blood circulation.
        It is interesting to note that the glasses are placed on strategic points.
        Also termed as pressure points they are similar to those used in the process of acupuncture.
        Once placed, the cups are left on the body for a period of ten to fifteen minutes.
        There are two kinds of cupping techniques.
        The first is termed as the massage cupping wherein the glasses are moved in a circular motion to provide relief to sore joints and affected tissues.
        The second technique is the stationery cupping wherein the cups are placed on a specific pressure point and not removed until the cession is over.</p>

      <h2>Ear Candling</h2>
      <p>Ear candling, also called ear coning or thermal-auricular therapy, is an alternative medicine practice claimed to improve general health and well-being by lighting one end of a hollow candle and placing the other end in the ear canal.
        Usually performed by lying on one side with the treated ear uppermost and the candle vertical.
        The candle can pierce through a paper plate or aluminum pie tin to protect against any hot wax or falling ash.
        The flame creates negative pressure, drawing wax and debris out of the ear canal, which appears as a dark residue.
        An ear candling session can last from 15 minutes to 45 minutes, during which time a series of one or two ear candles may be burned for each ear.</p>

      <h2>Swedish</h2>
      <p>Traditional Swedish massage was introduced by Swedish physiologist, Henri Peter Ling, in Stockholm, Sweden in the year 1812.
        This massage technique is characterised by its firm, yet calming pressure that improves blood circulation, eases muscle tension, and improves flexibility.
        Today, a Western-style Swedish massage still employs a series of long, gliding strokes, kneading of the muscles, and vibrational taps that are so common when one thinks of massage.
        A Swedish masseuse will also create friction and do whats called hacking or tapping across a clients back and shoulders to promote the release of tension.
        Five basic strokes gliding, kneading, vibrations, friction and hacking are all applied in the direction of the heart in order to encourage blood circulation and the disposal of bodily waste.
        A Swedish massage therapist will always use massage oils to achieve the smooth, long and deep strokes over their clients body.
        Therapists apply the oil to reduce friction, and essential oils are sometimes used in order to tap into a clients olphactory senses (sense of smell).
        During a Swedish massage a sheet is worn, otherwise the client is nude.
        However, body parts are only uncovered when they are being massaged.</p>

      <h2>Aromatherapy</h2>
      <p>Massage therapy is beneficial on its own; however when its used in conjunction with essential oils, these two therapies can be synergistically more beneficial than when they're performed separately.
        Aromatherapy massage involves a massage treatment using essential oils.
        The essential oils which refers to oils that come from the essence of plants - are a little oily, very fragrant, and usually too concentrated to be used undiluted.
        For this reason essential oils are typically blended with a carrier oil - such as jojoba or grapeseed oil - in order to dilute them so they dont harm the clients skin.
        They are chosen to therapeutically treat the emotional disorders of the client through the olfactory glands (through smell).
        Aromatherapy massage works when essential oils are inhaled by the client.
        When the fragrant oils are inhaled, a chemical message is sent to the brain which triggers a certain emotional response.</p>

      <h2>Lymphatic Drainage</h2>
      <p>The Lymphatic system is our front line of defence in fighting bodily infections, detoxifying the body and transporting metabolic wastes, excess water, bacteria and toxins out of the body.
        The Lymph glands (at neck, armpits, groin, etc.) are connected by a broad network of vessels which transplant the fluid.
        Muscular movement is required to move it, as there is no "Heart" to pump it.
        Lymphatic Drainage is a gentle whole body treatment that relaxes the nervous system and aids the body's immune system.
        It is highly recommended for those prone to and recovering from sore throats, colds, infections, on-going tiredness, excess fluids, low immunity, swollen node and also for the physically inactive.</p>

      <h2>Detox Exfoliating Body Scrub</h2>
      <p>Exfoliation involves the removal of the oldest dead skin cells on the skin's outermost surface and leaves the skin both looking and feeling smooth.
        A body scrub is a form of exfoliation.
        Each body scrub treatment is usually 30-60 minutes.
        New skin cells are created in the skin's lower layer, the dermis.
        Over time, cells migrate to the surface of the skin and become more acidic.
        During their 30 day journey, they die and become saturated with keratin.
        Keratin is important because it protects the skin from outside elements.
        Through the ageing process, and after menopause for women, the natural process of skin erosion becomes uneven, which gives skin a dry and rough character.
        Exfoliation removes the outer layer to reveal the newer skin beneath.
        This shedding of the outer layer unclogs pores, keeps skin clean, and helps reduce acne breakouts.
        Exfoliation should always be done after cleansing the skin.
        Exfoliation is important for men as it exposes the hair follicles, allowing a better shave.
        It is possible to over exfoliate, which dries and irritates the skin.
        The face is the part of the body most sensitive to exfoliation.
        Hence, provided that exfoliating causes the skin to dry out, it is very important to moisturise it, because dry skin can lead to wrinkle development.</p>

      <h2>Hot Oil Head &amp; Neck Massage</h2>
      <p>Hot oil massages can produce a number of benefits from head to toe.
        Starting with the scalp, it helps to improve circulation in both the head and neck.
        It relaxes the scalp and brings oxygenated blood to the roots of the hair thereby strengthening it.
        Massage encourages new hair growth, retards and slows the arrival of grey hair, reduces, dry flaky scalp and improves alertness and concentration.
        The types of oils most commonly used are almond oil because it has no smell, soybean oil, olive oil, gingelly oil (Sesame seed oil) or grape seed oil can all be used.
        The oil can be heated in the microwave oven or immersed in hot water; either method yields the same results.
        Once the oil is sufficiently hot, it is poured into the palms of the hand and rubbed together to spread the oil.
        Fingers are placed through the hair, onto the scalp and massage using a circular motion to stimulate the roots of the hair and scalp.</p>

      <h2>Cellulite Treatment</h2>
      <p>Cellulite is a topographic skin change that occurs in most postpubertal females.
        It presents as a modification of skin topography evident by skin dimpling and nodularity that occurs mainly in women on the pelvic region, lower limbs, and abdomen, and is caused by the herniation of subcutaneous fat within fibrous connective tissue, leading to a padded or orange peel-like appearance.
        Massage for cellulite reduction is a non-invasive technique that involves gently massaging away the lumps and bumps of cellulite.
        It is an effective and pleasant way of reducing the look of the condition.
        In this massage we attempt to break down the connections of fat deposits with the layers of skin to increase the local circulation and to energise the area.</p>

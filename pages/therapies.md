    <h1>Therapies</h1>
    <article>
      <p>My signature massage is actually a combination of styles and techniques.</p>
      <p>It's a whole body treatment, head, face, feet, tummy, back, hips, glutes, legs, arms, hands, shoulders, neck, ears, chest, some deep and light pressure, some stretches, trigger points and acupressure points.</p>
      <p>All performed using hot rocks or heat pads and ending with a soothing peppermint foot massage.</p>
      <p>This is by far my most common and favoured treatment.</p>
      <p>It will leave you feeling relaxed, youthful and relived of tension - no more aches and pains!</p>
      <p>I use only organic oils when doing my treatments. Base oils, massage blends and pure essential oils are available for purchase.</p>
      <p>All treatments times range from 15 minutes to 3 hours.</p>
      <p>The following therapies are available for you to pick and choose from:</p>

      <h2>Deep tissue</h2>
      <p>Deep tissue is a type of massage therapy that focuses on realigning deeper layers of muscles and connective tissue.
        It is especially helpful for chronically tense and contracted areas such as stiff necks, low back tightness, and sore shoulders.
        Some of the same strokes are used as classic massage therapy, but the movement is slower and the pressure is deeper and concentrated on areas of tension and pain.</p>

      <h2>Hot Stone</h2>
      <p>Hot stone massage is a variation on classic massage therapy. Heated smooth, flat stones are placed on key points on the body. The massage therapist may also hold the stones and use them to massage certain areas of the body.
        The hot stones are usually made of basalt, a type of rock that is rich in iron, so they retain heat.
        The stones are immersed in water and heated in an electric heating device until they are within a certain temperature range. The stones may be placed at specific points on the back, in the palms of the hand, or between the toes.
        The heat warms and relaxes the muscles, which allows the therapist to apply deeper pressure, if desired.</p>

      <h2>Pregnancy Massage</h2>
      <p>Prenatal massage refers to specific massage techniques that have been shown to reduce pregnancy discomforts and to enhance the physiological and emotional well-being of both mother and fetus.
        Pregnancy is a tumultuous period for a womans mind and body.
        Any woman who has been pregnant can sympathise with the mental and physical fatigue associated with being pregnant.
        Not only does a woman experience physical changes, she also experiences mental changes as well.
        Massage has been known to calm many of the aches and pains associated with pregnancy such as sciatica, swelling, back and neck pain, and stomach upset.
        Prenatal massage has also been shown to improve physical discomforts by encouraging circulation and by stretching the muscles and joints to their full range of motion to improve skin elasticity and body tone.
        Studies show that pregnant women who receive regular prenatal massages are more at ease - furthermore relaxing the fetus inside their womb.</p>

      <h2>Couples Massage</h2>
      <p>Looking for the perfect way to indulge yourself and your partner?
        Need some time to reconnect, relax and revive?
        You and your partner will enjoy the wonders of massage together in harmony in the same room side by side, by two different therapists.
        It can be a husband and wife, girlfriend and boyfriend, life partners, mums and daughters or even best friends.</p>

      <h2>Ear Candling</h2>
      <p>Ear candling, also called ear coning or thermal-auricular therapy, is an alternative medicine practice claimed to improve general health and well-being by lighting one end of a hollow candle and placing the other end in the ear canal.
        Usually performed by lying on one side with the treated ear uppermost and the candle vertical.
        The candle can pierce through a paper plate or aluminum pie tin to protect against any hot wax or falling ash.
        The flame creates negative pressure, drawing wax and debris out of the ear canal, which appears as a dark residue.
        An ear candling session can last from 15 minutes to 45 minutes, during which time a series of one or two ear candles may be burned for each ear.</p>

      <h2>Swedish</h2>
      <p>Traditional Swedish massage was introduced by Swedish physiologist, Henri Peter Ling, in Stockholm, Sweden in the year 1812.
        This massage technique is characterised by its firm, yet calming pressure that improves blood circulation, eases muscle tension, and improves flexibility.
        Today, a Western-style Swedish massage still employs a series of long, gliding strokes, kneading of the muscles, and vibrational taps that are so common when one thinks of massage.
        A Swedish masseuse will also create friction and do whats called hacking or tapping across a clients back and shoulders to promote the release of tension.
        Five basic strokes gliding, kneading, vibrations, friction and hacking are all applied in the direction of the heart in order to encourage blood circulation and the disposal of bodily waste.
        A Swedish massage therapist will always use massage oils to achieve the smooth, long and deep strokes over their clients body.
        Therapists apply the oil to reduce friction, and essential oils are sometimes used in order to tap into a clients olphactory senses (sense of smell).
        During a Swedish massage a sheet is worn, otherwise the client is nude.
        However, body parts are only uncovered when they are being massaged.</p>

      <h2>Aromatherapy</h2>
      <p>Massage therapy is beneficial on its own; however when its used in conjunction with essential oils, these two therapies can be synergistically more beneficial than when they're performed separately.
        Aromatherapy massage involves a massage treatment using essential oils.
        The essential oils which refers to oils that come from the essence of plants - are a little oily, very fragrant, and usually too concentrated to be used undiluted.
        For this reason essential oils are typically blended with a carrier oil - such as jojoba or grapeseed oil - in order to dilute them so they dont harm the clients skin.
        They are chosen to therapeutically treat the emotional disorders of the client through the olfactory glands (through smell).
        Aromatherapy massage works when essential oils are inhaled by the client.
        When the fragrant oils are inhaled, a chemical message is sent to the brain which triggers a certain emotional response.</p>

      <h2>Hot Oil Head &amp; Neck Massage</h2>
      <p>Hot oil massages can produce a number of benefits from head to toe.
        Starting with the scalp, it helps to improve circulation in both the head and neck.
        It relaxes the scalp and brings oxygenated blood to the roots of the hair thereby strengthening it.
        Massage encourages new hair growth, retards and slows the arrival of grey hair, reduces, dry flaky scalp and improves alertness and concentration.
        The types of oils most commonly used are almond oil because it has no smell, soybean oil, olive oil, gingelly oil (Sesame seed oil) or grape seed oil can all be used.
        The oil can be heated in the microwave oven or immersed in hot water; either method yields the same results.
        Once the oil is sufficiently hot, it is poured into the palms of the hand and rubbed together to spread the oil.
        Fingers are placed through the hair, onto the scalp and massage using a circular motion to stimulate the roots of the hair and scalp.</p>
